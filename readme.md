#  VBA challenge

In this homework assignment you will use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data.

1.Create a script that will loop through one year of stock data for each run and return the total volume each stock had over that year.

2.Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year for each run and take the following information.


--The ticker symbol.
--Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
--The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
--The total stock volume of the stock.

3.Solution able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

Considerations


Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This data set is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in less than 3-5 minutes.


Make sure that the script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button.
